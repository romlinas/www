WhitePlus is my second WordPress theme, done in about a week, with a clean, minimalistic look.


WhitePlus has the following features :

    * widget ready
    * author comments are highlighted
    * integrated tagcloud (wp_tags)
    * supports Gravatars
    * header psd included (images/header.psd)


Supports (not requires) the following plugins :

    * Similar Posts -> http://rmarsh.com/plugins/similar-posts/
    * WP-PageNavi -> http://lesterchan.net/portfolio/programming/php/


The header was made by the tool developed by the guys over at X3Studios, visit them when you have the chance.



I am looking forward for your feedback.

### Featured Images ###

This theme relies heavily on Featured Images. The Featured Image will be featured on the Home and Archive pages.


### Post Formats ###

Snaps supports the following post formats &mdash; standard, image and gallery.


### Embed Multimedia into Posts or Pages ###

For externally hosted videos (for example a YouTube or Vimeo video), you can directly paste the link of your video page into the content editor. You do not have to paste the embed code. WordPress will automatically embed the video from the link.

You can easily embed videos from a Video hosting service such as Vimeo or YouTube into your posts or pages.

To add a video:

1. From your WordPress dashboard, add a new post or page (or edit an existing post or page).
2. Paste in your video’s URL, for example https://vimeo.com/31985752.
3. Publish or Update your post or page.

*Please note: If your video is not appearing correctly, remove the ‘s’ from the URL, so https becomes http.*

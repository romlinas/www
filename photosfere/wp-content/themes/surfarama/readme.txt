ABOUT Theme
=========== 
Surfarama is a bold and fun theme which uses the popular mason style layout on the home page and category pages to highlight imagery and make for a very visual presentation. It's perfect for travel and magazine style blogs heavy on the imagery. The theme is highly customizable with the ability to upload your own logo, set the background color (or image), the primary theme color and even color code the categories without any coding required.

This theme is compatible with Wordpress Version 3.4 and above and it supports the new theme customization API (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API).

All the image graphics and icons bundled with this theme are created by the author and licensed under the GPL.

The images used in the screenshot can be found here: http://surfarama.com/

Supported browsers: Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari and IE9+ (Some css3 styles like shadows and rounder corners are not supported by IE8 and below).
